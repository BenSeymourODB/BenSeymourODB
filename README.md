- 👋 Hi, I’m @BenSeymourODB.
- 👀 I’m interested in .NET web applications, making sense of old spaghetti code, and automating boring tasks of every kind.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning better SQL practices to better maintain a ton of legacy applications.
- 🎓 I'm a graduate from [@CedarvilleCS](https://github.com/CedarvilleCS).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on utility packages for .NET and ASP.NET applications.
- 📫 If you work with [@rbcministries](https://github.com/rbcministries), send me a Slack message in the main workspace. Otherwise, tag me on Twitter [@B_SeeMore](https://twitter.com/B_SeeMore).
